        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Coronavirus (more formally referred to as novel Coronavirus; or COVID-19) is a
            large family of viruses that has newly been identified in humans.
            Coronavirus has proven to be a serious threat to the wellbeing of many people across the world.
            According to <cite><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">CDC</a></cite> of July 26th,
            2020 there have been over 4,163,892 confirmed cases in U.S alone and the daily rate of
            confirmed cases keeps is not slowing down but rather it is accelerating. The current situation of how the government is handling
            the pandemic is worrying and people don’t seem to know the danger of such disease as I observed more and more peoples failed
            to participate in social distancing. We are interested in researching the reason behinds the increasing daily rate of confirmed
            cases in U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that people has been relaxed their vigilance of COVID-19 diseases as economic recovery begins and no longer paying attention
            to their surroundings. <cite><a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/"></a>Johns Hopkins University</cite> created an interactive map for COVID-19 cases, and there is news provide the latest
            update of COVID-19 cases near us like the <cite><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/white-house-pushes-narrow-virus-aid-pelosi-blasts-gop-delay/">Seattle Times</a></cite> 
            , there are guidelines for how to prevent disease, and check points for people 
            to test whether they have been infected. But no one is putting all that information together to provide a detailed web page for people
            to have a full understanding of the current situation unless people spend times and start digging these information.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>I would like to work with Helen Zhao for this project</p>
        <p>
            The user of this application is all Americans that want to learn more about COVID-19 especially of the confirmed cases near them, simply looking 
            at the number for confirmed cases rises does not give much useful information but if they can get information of how people get infected, where 
            they went or what activities causes them to be infected, or even what happened if they get infected. I believe such information would help people to
            have a better understanding of what should they do to prevent them from getting the disease. The application would contain not only the COVID-19 cases
            drawn data provided by <cite><a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">Johns Hopkins University</a></cite> but also news related to COVID-19 from news Website
            such as <cite><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/white-house-pushes-narrow-virus-aid-pelosi-blasts-gop-delay/">Seattle Times</a></cite>, 
            <cite><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/25/uk/boris-johnson-nicola-sturgeon-coronavirus-approach-gbr-intl/index.html">CNN</a></cite> , and more.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Functionality of the Application:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Real-time data drawn from <cite><a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins University</a></cite> about COVID-19 cases in which people can select states and countries based on user lives.</li>
                <li>Viewing the latest local news or global news about the progress of vaccine or what other country does that help getting the pandemic under control.</li>
                <li> Information that helps the user to prevent from getting infected such as how to wear a mask or what should people do in the first places after they come back from outside.</li>
                <li class="special-functionality">User can post messages to the website blog that can report people who might have been infected with disease or places that is too dangerous to go for
                    another user to keep an eye of when they are going out and to support each other.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <p>
            With an application that could provide all the information people needed to know about COVID-19 without having them to spend extra times to digging around the internet.
            I believe that would have a better understanding of what they should do and what they shouldn’t do to help people prevent from getting infected. But more importantly,
            the blog allows people to support each other by providing extra information’s that might not appear in the public.
